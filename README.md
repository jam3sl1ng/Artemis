 - so basically you need to go on your Linux OS and go through ollama and download starling-lm to test it
 - then you need to run it, 
 - commands: ollama pull starling-lm, ollama run starling-lm
 - also you need to setup the following python script I'm gonna add to this repo and run it, I would recommend doing this bit on windows as Nvidia is a pain.
